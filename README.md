## SoyMates

SoyMates is a sushi recipe/review application. You can create an account and login. Once logged in, you can filter existing recipes by name or roll-type. You can also add your own sushi recipes. Each sushi "card" provides a description, as well as an option to leave a review. 

This is the frontend for the project. Check out the backend [here](https://github.com/1-8192/soymates-back-end "SoyMates Backend").
